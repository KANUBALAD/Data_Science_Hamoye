    "A simple linear regression model estimates the relationship between two quantitative variables where one is referred to as the independent variable and the other the dependent variable. The independent variable (X) is used to predict and also called the predictor while the predicted variable is referred to as the response variable (Y) (e.g. finding the relationship between the amount of CO2 gas emitted and the number of trees cut down). The value of Y can be obtained from X by finding the line of best fit (regression line) with minimum error for the data points on a scatter plot for both variables. A simple linear regression can be represented as:"

The objective is to minimise the cost function in order for the model to continuously learn to obtain better results. In linear regression, the cost function can be defined as the sum of squared errors in a training set. The squares of the residuals are taken to penalise errors farther from the line of best fit more than those closer to the line and obtain the best parameter values. "

    "Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that minimizes a cost function by specifying the direction to move towards to obtain a local or global minima. This is done by initially starting with random values then iteratively updating the values until the minimum cost is obtained.  A learning rate is usually chosen to determine the step size to be taken for each iteration. It is important to carefully select this parameter because, if a small step is chosen, it will take a long time to converge to the minimum cost while if too large, it can result in an overshoot surpassing the location of the minimum cost."
