    "How well a regression model performs can be obtained by how close the predicted value is to the ground truth. It is very important to use the appropriate metric to evaluate the performance. In this section, we discuss some examples of metrics used in evaluating regression models such as RSS, R-Squared, RMSE and MAE"

    "MAE  is easy and intuitive such that it calculates the sum of the  average of the absolute error between the predicted values and the true values. Since the absolute difference is taken, this metric does not consider direction. However, because the absolute difference is obtained, it is unable to give information about the model overshooting or undershooting. The smaller the MAE is, the better the model. Therefore, if the MAE is 0, the model is perfect and accurately predicts results which is almost impossible.  The mean absolute error is more robust to outliers.\n",

    "Also known as the sum of squared residuals (SSR), this metric explains the variance in the representation of the dataset by the model; it measures how well the model approximates the data. A residual is the estimated error made by a model. In simpler terms, it is the difference between the nth true value and the nth predicted value by the model. RSS is the sum of the square of errors between the residuals in a model. The lower the RSS, the better the modelâ€™s estimations and vice versa.\n",

It describes the spread of the residuals from the line of best fit and the noise in the model.

It is calculated by summing the squares of the residuals and dividing by the number of observations.\n",
